## Versor and Operation

### A single vector
Given a single vector $$a$$, we can decompose an arbitrary vector along the given vector:
\$$
x=x(aa^-1)=(x\cdot a)a^{-1}+(x\wedge a)a^{-1}=x_{\perp}+x_{\parallel}
$$

Hence:
\$$
\underline{a}(x) = -a^{-1}xa =(x\wedge a - x\cdot a)a^{-1} = x_{\parallel} - x_{\perp}
$$

can represent a reflection.

### Product of two vectors

Let $$\underline{R}(x) =(ab)^{-1}x(ab) $$. This operation is a combination of two reflections. Decompose $$x$$ along an axis perpendicular to both $$a$$ and $$b$$, then it's easy to see that $$x_{\perp}$$ doesn't change; what remains is combination of reflections in a plane, which is plain.

The product $$ab$$ of two vectors generates a rotationn through twice the angle between $$a$$ and $$b$$.

Notice that $$(ba)^{-1}x(ba) = -\underline{R} $$.

## Versor Group

The vesor group would be finite if there is a smallest integer $$p$$ for which $$\underline{R}^p =1 $$. If we adopt $$a$$ and $$b$$ as generators of a vesor group, the vesor group will be extended to include reflections.
