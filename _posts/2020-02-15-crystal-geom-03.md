The symmetry of a pattern which involves translational repetition is called a *space group*. Every space group has a set of characteristic.

## Characteristic Features

### Basic chatracteristics

1. It is isogonal with one of the 32 point groups. 
2. It has the translations of one of the lattice types permitted by that point group.
3. Its symmetry elements consist of one combination of the possible space-group operations which can be substituted for the corresponding operations of the isogonal point group.

Within a given point gtoup, a swpce group is characterized by:

1. The specific lattice type of the several general types available.
2. The specific combination of possible space-group symmetry elements which are used as substituents for the symmetry elements of the isogonal point group.

For each of six possible parts of the point-group symbol there is a corresponding part of the space-group symbol; this shows which particular isogonal space-group symmetry element takes place of a point-group symmetry element.

In the space-group symbols, this sequence of symmetry symbols is preceded bya symbol indicating the general lattice type ($$P,A,B,C,I,F,\text( or )R$$). The complete symbol consists first of a capital letter indicating the lattice type, and then a sequence of not more than three symbols.
